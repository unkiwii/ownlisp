* add floating point numbers (doubles)
* add modulo (%) operator
* add pow (^) operator
* change lval to become an union instead of an struct
* as "def" add a "del" to remove a symbol from the environment
    "del" must search the current environment and delete the first symbol
    it finds (from env to parent env, and so on) so it can work with "def"
    and also with "="
* change print of builtin function to print its name
* make all "list" functions to work on strings also
* add file handling
* load "prelude.l" at the start of the repl (or program)
* add a hash table of variables
    instead of storing them as strings and performing a linear search, make
    a hash table to store the variables
* add a typesystem
